# Before Git Codes
 Codes made before knowing the GIT system. Contains codes in C, Java, MatLab, MQL5 and Python.
 
## MatLab-Event-Triggered-Papper-Codes
Contains the codes used for the formulation of the paper "Observer-based event-triggered control for discrete-time systems in the presence of sector-bounded nonlinear inputs" - [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336485500_Observer-based_event-triggered_control_for_discrete-time_systems_in_the_presence_of_sector-bounded_nonlinear_inputs), all made in MatLab and commented in English.

## Python-Xray-Inversion

It contains a jupyter notebook with commented codes in English (but the report was written in French) that emulate the reading of an X-ray machine, using data inversion with tikhonov reluarization. To this end, the translation of the MatLab codes "myphantom.m" and "paralleltomo.m" was performed.

## Tina-DESTool-Automates-Petry-Simulated-Plant

Contains the control of a plant designed with FlexFact software, as shown in the video "Video_1538424420.wmv". For this project, the DESTool software was used to perform the modeling and control by automatons (as in the video). The version of control by petry networks was also performed, but with the Tina software, such software cannot perform direct communication with FlexFact so the simulation was performed only on the network itself. Contains report of the two models, in portuguese br

## Arduino-Electrical-Plant-Control

Contains code for sampling a plant by electrical voltage. It also contains a report (in pt-br) comparing plant identification by the sampled data against theoretical modeling. In addition, it contains code to apply the control of such plant, all in Arduino.

## C-1024Game-BasicLibraries

Contains game 1024 all formulated in C, using only standard C libraries. All commented in Portuguese Br

## Java-SimulatedTerminal-BasicLibraries

Contains the simulation of an ATM, all performed in basic JAVA functions, commented on pt br

## C-AVR-SimulatedTerminal-BasicLibraries

Contains codes to perform serial communication from one AVR microprocessor with another server, using an arduino (but fully programmed with basic functions of the AVR microprocessor) without GUI. Such codes have a fast performance and are all commented in pt-br
